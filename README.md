Code to reproduce the experiments on D-Wave quantum annealer reported in "Collective preparation of large quantum registers with high fidelity" https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16706

The file containing the main experiments is 'pegasus_reset.py'. The other files are other preliminary experiments and trials we have made along the way.
If you happen to use this code plase cite the paper accordingly.
