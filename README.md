Code to reproduce the experiments on D-Wave quantum annealer reported in "Collective preparation of large quantum registers with high fidelity" https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16706

The file containing the main experiments is 'pegasus_reset.py'. The other files contain other preliminary experiments, helper functions that we carried over from previous projects and trials we have made along the way.
If you happen to use this code plase cite the paper accordingly.
